## Superconductivity Research


The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. We showed that it's easier to create the conditions for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials than in arbitrary materials. 
Here are some of the materials I studied (drawn in Reciprocal Space).

We found that by tuning the strength of the potential, you can create spikes in the density of states (or "DOS" as shown in the plots below). This can lead to instabilities in the material, including superconductivity. Here are some of the simulations I created.

You can accurately calculate the Energy Spectrum of the material by using Perturbation Theory. Here's a diagram of some of the resulting matrices:
