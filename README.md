## Superconductivity Research

This repository demonstrates a new possible class of superconducting material. We show that it's easier to create the conditions for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials than in arbitrary materials. 
Here are some rotationally symmetric materials (drawn in Reciprocal Space).

By tuning the material you can create spikes in the density of states (or "DOS" as shown in the plots below). This can lead to instabilities in the material, including superconductivity. Here are some of the simulations of this in this repository.

You can accurately calculate the Energy Spectrum of the material by using Perturbation Theory. Here's a diagram of some of the resulting matrices:

This is evidence that rotationally symmetric materials might make good superconductors, but it would take a lot of work to actually grow the material and verify this.
